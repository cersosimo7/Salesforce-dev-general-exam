# Lightning Developer Code Challenge

## Overview
This challenge focuses on 3 parts:

* Creating Apex services that map to a third-party [REST API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
* Writing Apex unit tests with 100% code coverage
* Wiring up your Apex services to either an Aura Component (`<c:PuppyViewer />`) or a Lightning Web Component (`<c-dog-viewer></c-dog-viewer>`). Both of these components are provided in their static form for you to use.

## Setup
1. Sign up for a new [Dev hub org](https://developer.salesforce.com/promotions/orgs/dx-signup)
2. Create a default scratch org to do your work in
3. Clone this repository
4. Check the "Issues" tab

## The API
Dog API is a third-party API that your application will consume. It is free for development purposes, so there is no sign up or OAuth required. Documentation can be found here: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/.

You will be using GET requests to build a form to get images of dogs. From here, you will leverage the platform to store favorite dog photos captured from the API. Details are located in the Issues tab of this repository.
